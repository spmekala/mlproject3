All analysis was done using the latest stable version of the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), provided for free by the University of Waikato.

Installation:
1. Install Java 8 JDK
2. Install the latest stable version of WEKA

4. Run experiments

Where to find my files:
- everything should be pretty straightforward; all the code for the algorithms that I used was provided with WEKA
- original datasets and clustered Datasets are in datasets/

Parameters and other requirements for performing the experiments are all default unless otherwise specified in paper
